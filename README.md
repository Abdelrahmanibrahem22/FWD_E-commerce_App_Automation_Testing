# FWD_E-commerce_App_Automation_Testing
Project introduction
This Project requires you to automate and generate a report for a created test plan for an e-commerce application to test all possible test scenarios.

It's required to automate a test plan for an e-commerce application to test all possible test scenarios and test cases for the major functionalities of the e-commerce website/app. This E-commerce application has a log-in page w/ username and password with no extra authentication other than the email password.

The app has displayed items with pricing which when pressed, are added to the user's personal shopping cart. The shopping cart can be then discarded by deleting items or the user can proceed to the payment options. The testing team has created the test protocol with all the testing scenarios and test cases.

You are required to automate all the test cases and generate a testing report w/ the status of features using each test case/scenario status (PASS/FAIL), the execution time of the automated test, and the testing steps status (PASS/FAIL)
